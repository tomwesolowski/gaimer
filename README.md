Reinforcement Learning library for games.

We strive to create a simple (to use) framework for various games and allow users to create, train and debug their bots.

## Pacman

We've implemented a Pacman game. You can try it out by simply running:

`python driver.py`

If you'd like to create custom map, open `maps.py` file, create your own environment and modify `driver.py` script.

By default, our simple bot is ran. You can see how our pacman agent face ghosts armed with TD-lambda algorithm. 

## More games soon...
